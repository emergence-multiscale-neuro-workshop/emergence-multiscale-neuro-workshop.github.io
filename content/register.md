### Workshop Registration

The organizing committee and the Fields Institute are committed to facilitating access and minizing barriers to scientific education, training, exposure to cutting-edge research, and academic career development. 

Attendance is therefore free of charge. 

All planning to attend, go to the [Fields website event page](https://fields.institute/activities/25-26/neuroscience-multiscale) to register. Due to space restrictions, there are a limited number of places available.
